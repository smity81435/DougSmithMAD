Created by Douglas Scott Smith 
for Mobile App Development ATLAS 

This application takes the user's location and uses those coordinates in conjunction with an API to retrieve the local weather data. After the local temperature has been determined, the application then does a simple calculation to determine the optimal type of ski wax to apply to your skis in those conditions, and shows the user that type of wax.
